## Introduction

The SSO Domain project is responsible for managing the authentication and authorization process for multiple applications within a single sign-on environment. It leverages NextAuth, a flexible authentication library for Next.js applications.

## Features

- Centralized authentication and authorization for multiple applications
- Support for various authentication providers (e.g., email/password, social logins)
- Session management and token-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for fine-grained authorization
- Customizable login and registration flows

## Installation

To install and run the SSO Domain project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sso-implementation.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   cd sso-domain
   yarn install
   ```

3. Configure the environment variables (see [Configuration](#configuration) section).

4. Start the development server:

   ```shell
   yarn dev
   ```

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can access the SSO Domain application at `http://localhost:3000`. From there, you can perform various authentication and authorization operations, such as logging in, registering new users, and managing user roles.

## Configuration

The SSO Domain project requires the following environment variables to be set:

- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: The base URL of the SSO Domain application.
- `DATABASE_URL`: The URL of the database used for storing user information and session data.
- `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key used for signing and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
- `...` (add any other required environment variables)

You can set these variables either in a `.env` file or through your hosting provider's environment configuration.
